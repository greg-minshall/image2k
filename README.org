imagemean was developed to look for problems in sensors of digital
cameras.  it does this by creating an output image file where each
pixel location in the output image file takes on the average value of
the same pixel location in each of the image files.

all input files must have the same geometry, e.g., 5976x3992.  this
means that if, e.g., you have rotated an image (so it is now, e.g.,
3992x5976), imagemean will fail.  the solution is to either exclude
the rotated file from the processing, or to rotate it back to its
original position.  (if you've rotated a file 180 degrees, it will
*look* to be the same geometry, but imagemean won't be looking at
pixels from the same location in the sensor.)
