Description: image2k creates pixmaps from any image file that is
  supported by the Imlib2 and/or MagickWand libraries (assuming one or
  both of these libraries are available on your machine).  similarly,
  given a pixmap, image2k can write that to an image file using either
  Imlib2 and/or MagickWand.  (MagickWand is an optional library from
  ImageMagick.)

Depends: pixmap
Suggests: digest, getopt, methods
SystemRequirements: libImlib2, libMagickWand
Note: image2k requires *one* of libImlib2, libMagickWand, though if
      both are on the system, that will provide more flexibility at
      run time.
